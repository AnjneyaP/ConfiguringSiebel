# Toolbar Icon Overrides

Assuming you've added a [custom icon pack](https://github.com/OracleSiebel/ConfiguringSiebel/tree/master/ExampleCode/Open%20UI/Theme%20Customizations/Snippets/Add%20an%20Icon%20Pack), this snippet gives you the details you need to adjust one or more of the Toolbar icons. Just pick up the CSS for the icon(s) you want to change. In this case, they've all been selected from FontAwesome (so you'd need to have added that).
